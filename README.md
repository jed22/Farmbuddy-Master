# Farmbuddy-Master
Official Git Hub repository for Bukidnon State  University capstone project 'Farm Buddy'

week # (April 3 to 7 )

  A few days after the successful release of our project. We have once
  again discussed about the new requirements of NCOS for the next version
  of SWE Portal which is v14. Our tl briefly discussed about the flow
  of the entire application to us so that we can understand the project
  better and formulate some specific scenarios which errors may occur. We
  were once again amazed by how certain datas are passed from one server
  to another inside the companies intranet by using  the project which 
  we are currently developing.

  During this week, we also continued our training with Boss RD and this 
  time he have given us a group task to create a class diagram for a 
  specific module in our capstone projects while emplementing either
  builder,factory or abstract factory design pattern.
  
  When our TL gaved each of the members their assigned task, we worked on 
  it until end of the week. Most of the task is about SRS (Software Re
  quirement Specification) creation, converting the ncos requirements to
  a more clean and understandable document. 
  
  
  week # ( April 10 to 12)
  It's the holy week but only thursday and friday is the non working days.
  But our TL have already asked for a leave for a whole week so she can go with her family
  for a vacation somewhere. Still, with the assigned task, we continued to
  work on our task. Me and alex even ended up reviewing each other's work 
  instead since Mr. Claracay is still busy checking about a specific bug.
  All 3 days of this week continued. Unfortunately, we were not able to meet
  with Boss RD since he was very busy aswell.
  
  week # (April 17 to 21)
  After 4 days worth being free of work. Next week finally came in and
  we continued our task. Both our TL who just came back from her vacation
  and Mr.Claracay came in the office during the afternoon. With no further
  discussion we continued our work and discussed a bit. After a few hours
  our TL called for a meeting so that we can report the things that we've 
  finished. She also have given us another task which is related to BD
  (Basic Design). 
  
  During this week, our TL was very busy communicating with the people from
  NCOS discussing about many things. 
  
  For the first time here in the company, we OJTs are able to join the the
  gathering of NEC employees. They held it once every month, a small gathering
  with all the food and some entertaining stuffs. It was fun but really akward for me since
  all the employees were there but it seems really normal for them already.
  
  During this week also, our TL once again called for a meeting and 
  she have given us a BD task . The task is to create operation sheets for 
  each main and subwindow of the application. Operation sheets provides all the
  information about all the things inside a main/sub-window where operation
  may occur.
  
  
  week # (Feb 20-24)
  
   During this week, sir Nolan grouped us in a meeting room to discuss a bit about their project's life cycle. 
   He discussed about document management, how to separate this from that. And that phases each projects
   undergo. All of it was clearly explained and I started appriciating this line of work more. Being 
   neat about everything so that future project members won't have a hard time figuring out how and what
   to do. A few days after our discussion we took an online quiz where i got a mediocre score.
   
   Our release date for the project's current version is nearly there so all of the project engineers needs
   to pick up the pace, OJTs included. After every meeting we rush to do things quickly. Since our TL during
   this time is out for 1 week, our direct project manager Mr. de Castro took over and called a meeting 
   with all the members of the team. Before our TL went out he said both of them had a small dicussion about
   the current situation and called the meeting to further clarify things. Obviously everyone is acting
   more behaved and answer each question asked seriously. There was also a funny moment where he asked me
   and Alex to call the OJTs to join the meeting, pretty much means we don't look like OJTs anymore.
   
   
   
   week # (feb-march 27 - 3 )
   
   Release date is near, our TL had already came back and is ready to roll. Each day  the four members including
   me and Alex are given a certain amount of target IT specifications to be tested. With a total of 26,000+
   test specs, all of us is really in a rush. Other members also went and continued to do their Unit testing
   as discussed last week during the meeting with Mr.de Castro. One thing I learned is that, since our team
   does not have a dedicated testing team, the coders are also the testers.  But to prevent biased kind of testing
   which may not lead to finding any errors/bugs. Each coders will not be assigned to Unit Test the modules which they
   are handling, instead they will be Unit Testing other members module. Which makes the odd of finding a bug 
   higher. 
   
   Also during this week, all the OJTs gathered once again for our training sessions and to my surprise, 
   the person who initiated the meeting is Mr.de Castro. He told us OJTs that we will be having all
   design pattern trainings with him, that we will be doing problem based learning and the software technologies
   which we may be using for this incoming training sessions. But first, he would like to estimate all of us OJTs
   about our understanding in OOP. He said we really can't proceed directly to design pattern without understanding
   the OOP concepts. So he said that  next meeting, he will give us a short test to further enligthen him. He divided us to
   2 groups and given each of the group a certain real world object and create a UML class diagram about it, and it 
   should be object oriented.
   
  week # (March 6-10)
  We started the first day of the week with an early session with boss RD at the video conference room. Both OJT teams 
  presented their OOP enterpretation of the given real world objects. To be honest, I didn't really understand the
  things which we needed to do so we ended up presenting a class diagram of an object with a horrible OOP representation.
  Bloated classes, no encapsulation and the UML was very confusing just by looking at it. Ofcourse Boss RD was disappointed
  but he said that he understands what's happening. So he decided to take a short pause before continuing to design pattern.
  His plan was to make us understand the basic OOP concepts first using real world scenarios and do the same thing again and
  again until he was satisfied.He also lectured us a bit about OOP and the things which we did wrong in the presentation. 
  After the meeting, he have given us another task which is almost the same as before but his expectations now is higher.
  
  As usual we continued our task which was provided by sir Pateres. He divided the parts equally to the IT members then
  gaved some to the engineers who was already finished with theur Unit Testing. The client was also worried about the
  project so he does email our team daily, asking about the progress and providing help if needed. Our TL also told us that they 
  will going to japan this coming March 20 to join with our NCOS client for the release of the project's current version.
  but his expectations is now higher than before.
  
  week # ( March 13-17)
  During this week we had continued our linux training with sir Nolan, we watched videos which talks about the basic
  linux commands and some good practices. The video is a bit old though but it was still really usefull. Though
  we still really have to dig deeper in order to really appreciate a linux operating system can do. After that
  we went back to each of our respective teams and continued working as usual.
  
  At this point in time, all of us were all almost done with testing. We also reported quite a few bugs and was fixed
  really fast as well. Some of the bugs i reported was has miniscule effect to the project since most of the devastating
  bugs are found during Unit Testing, but a bug is still a bug no matter how much of an impact it may bring to the application.
  Sometimes i find it hard to report some bugs because it will be added again to the coders heavy load of work.
  
  Friday quickly came. Everything was almost sorted out and everyone was excited for the release. Next week there will be no one
  to monitor us engineers but we will still continue working since we're not entirely done just yet. And about the trip to Japan
  ofcourse i felt a bit ofenvy for our 2 main members because they will be the one to go to Japan. Japan is a really nice place, 
  i know since i watched a lot of documentaries about them before. I told myself that someday, I will travel to Japan someday and 
  not because I have some business stuffs to attend to but just to take a tour and have fun. Ofcourse traveling free with business
  stuffs is also an option.
  
  week # ( March 20-24)
  We started the week without our 2 main members, but still we're still communicating through emails and chat applications. Whenever
  theres something that needs to be done, our TL just emails us all the way from Japan then we would immediately work on that.
  During this time, we're doing retest for the NG items and initial test for the CT items which was not performed. It's still a lot 
  of work though since the CT and NG items were the most complicated to test. Some CT items requires us to change the settings of the
  application to use a Linux IP instead of windows to get certain datas like help manuals and other stuffs, then we test if the
  application can go and pickup the data using the path provided. Sometimes it fails not because the file wasn't there but because
  of wrong mapping. Overall it wasn't as time consuming as the previous week so whenever I'm able to have some free time, i read
  online discussions,tutorials, best practices and other stuffs worth learning while I'm still here.
  
  During this week, our OOP discussion also continued. After our presentation, we were once again given another item and was 
  paired to one another. This time our assigned object is an elevator which was  decided by my partner Ynna. It was pretty hard
  and requires some research since we obviously don't know the parts which makes up an elevator. So after going off from work,
  we spent quite some time discussing and figuring out the parts and the things which needs to be included in the diagram.
  Another day came and all of the pairs presented their own works. Unfortunately we we're the last one, after Earls group
  finished discussing, the next group followed. Unexpectedly Mr.Nolan entered the room and listened to our discussion. He
  also thrown some helpful suggestions and corrections to our works. I thought our group did pretty good there but it was still
  not enough and we ended up with another round of the same thing, this time implementing the Interface classes well. Knowing
  when and how to use Interface classes is one of the most important part of OOP. Just like Abstract classes, Interface are 
  classes which can't be instantiated but they differ according to usage. I decided to study about it more during breaks, I've
  feeling really disappointed about myself during our failed attempts since it kinda reflect us as well so our only choice is 
  to do good next time. Ofcourse everytime we're done discussing about our task, Boss RD shares some of his knowledge to us
  and gives us instructions as to how you properly do the task given.
