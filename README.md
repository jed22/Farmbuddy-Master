# Farmbuddy-Master
Official Git Hub repository for Bukidnon State  University capstone project 'Farm Buddy'

week # (April 3 to 7 )

  A few days after the successful release of our project. We have once
  again discussed about the new requirements of NCOS for the next version
  of SWE Portal which is v14. Our tl briefly discussed about the flow
  of the entire application to us so that we can understand the project
  better and formulate some specific scenarios which errors may occur. We
  were once again amazed by how certain datas are passed from one server
  to another inside the companies intranet by using  the project which 
  we are currently developing.

  During this week, we also continued our training with Boss RD and this 
  time he have given us a group task to create a class diagram for a 
  specific module in our capstone projects while emplementing either
  builder,factory or abstract factory design pattern.
  
  When our TL gaved each of the members their assigned task, we worked on 
  it until end of the week. Most of the task is about SRS (Software Re
  quirement Specification) creation, converting the ncos requirements to
  a more clean and understandable document. 
  
  
  week # ( April 10 to 12)
  It's the holy week but only thursday and friday is the non working days.
  But our TL have already asked for a leave for a whole week so she can go with her family
  for a vacation somewhere. Still, with the assigned task, we continued to
  work on our task. Me and alex even ended up reviewing each other's work 
  instead since Mr. Claracay is still busy checking about a specific bug.
  All 3 days of this week continued. Unfortunately, we were not able to meet
  with Boss RD since he was very busy aswell.
  
  week # (April 17 to 21)
  After 4 days worth being free of work. Next week finally came in and
  we continued our task. Both our TL who just came back from her vacation
  and Mr.Claracay came in the office during the afternoon. With no further
  discussion we continued our work and discussed a bit. After a few hours
  our TL called for a meeting so that we can report the things that we've 
  finished. She also have given us another task which is related to BD
  (Basic Design). 
  
  During this week, our TL was very busy communicating with the people from
  NCOS discussing about many things. 
  
  For the first time here in the company, we OJTs are able to join the the
  gathering of NEC employees. They held it once every month, a small gathering
  with all the food and some entertaining stuffs. It was fun but really akward for me since
  all the employees were there but it seems really normal for them already.
  
  During this week also, our TL once again called for a meeting and 
  she have given us a BD task . The task is to create operation sheets for 
  each main and subwindow of the application. Operation sheets provides all the
  information about all the things inside a main/sub-window where operation
  may occur.
  
  
  week # (Feb 20-24)
  
   During this week, sir Nolan grouped us in a meeting room to discuss a bit about their project's life cycle. 
   He discussed about document management, how to separate this from that. And that phases each projects
   undergo. All of it was clearly explained and I started appriciating this line of work more. Being 
   neat about everything so that future project members won't have a hard time figuring out how and what
   to do. A few days after our discussion we took an online quiz where i got a mediocre score.
   
   Our release date for the project's current version is nearly there so all of the project engineers needs
   to pick up the pace, OJTs included. After every meeting we rush to do things quickly. Since our TL during
   this time is out for 1 week, our direct project manager Mr. de Castro took over and called a meeting 
   with all the members of the team. Before our TL went out he said both of them had a small dicussion about
   the current situation and called the meeting to further clarify things. Obviously everyone is acting
   more behaved and answer each question asked seriously. There was also a funny moment where he asked me
   and Alex to call the OJTs to join the meeting, pretty much means we don't look like OJTs anymore.
   
   
   
   week # (feb-march 27 - 3 )
   
   Release date is near, our TL had already came back and is ready to roll. Each day  the four members including
   me and Alex are given a certain amount of target IT specifications to be tested. With a total of 26,000+
   test specs, all of us is really in a rush. Other members also went and continued to do their Unit testing
   as discussed last week during the meeting with Mr.de Castro. One thing I learned is that, since our team
   does not have a dedicated testing team, the coders are also the testers.  But to prevent biased kind of testing
   which may not lead to finding any errors/bugs. Each coders will not be assigned to Unit Test the modules which they
   are handling, instead they will be Unit Testing other members module. Which makes the odd of finding a bug 
   higher. 
   
   Also during this week, all the OJTs gathered once again for our training sessions and to my surprise, 
   the person who initiated the meeting is Mr.de Castro. He told us OJTs that we will be having all
   design pattern trainings with him, that we will be doing problem based learning and the software technologies
   which we may be using for this incoming training sessions. But first, he would like to estimate all of us OJTs
   about our understanding in OOP. He said we really can't proceed directly to design pattern without understanding
   the OOP concepts. So he said that  next meeting, he will give us a short test to further enligthen him. He divided us to
   2 groups and given each of the group a certain real world object and create a UML class diagram about it, and it 
   should be object oriented.
