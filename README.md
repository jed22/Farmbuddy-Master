# Farmbuddy-Master
Official Git Hub repository for Bukidnon State  University capstone project 'Farm Buddy'

week # (April 3 to 7 )

  A few days after the successful release of our project. We have once
  again discussed about the new requirements of NCOS for the next version
  of SWE Portal which is v14. Our tl briefly discussed about the flow
  of the entire application to us so that we can understand the project
  better and formulate some specific scenarios which errors may occur. We
  were once again amazed by how certain datas are passed from one server
  to another inside the companies intranet by using  the project which 
  we are currently developing.

  During this week, we also continued our training with Boss RD and this 
  time he have given us a group task to create a class diagram for a 
  specific module in our capstone projects while emplementing either
  builder,factory or abstract factory design pattern.
  
  When our TL gaved each of the members their assigned task, we worked on 
  it until end of the week. Most of the task is about SRS (Software Re
  quirement Specification) creation, converting the ncos requirements to
  a more clean and understandable document. 
  
  
  week # ( April 10 to 12)
  It's the holy week but only thursday and friday is the non working days.
  But our TL have already asked for a leave for a whole week so she can go with her family
  for a vacation somewhere. Still, with the assigned task, we continued to
  work on our task. Me and alex even ended up reviewing each other's work 
  instead since Mr. Claracay is still busy checking about a specific bug.
  All 3 days of this week continued. Unfortunately, we were not able to meet
  with Boss RD since he was very busy aswell.
  
  week # (April 17 to 21)
  After 4 days worth being free of work. Next week finally came in and
  we continued our task. Both our TL who just came back from her vacation
  and Mr.Claracay came in the office during the afternoon. With no further
  discussion we continued our work and discussed a bit. After a few hours
  our TL called for a meeting so that we can report the things that we've 
  finished. She also have given us another task which is related to BD
  (Basic Design). 
  
  During this week, our TL was very busy communicating with the people from
  NCOS discussing about many things. 
  
  For the first time here in the company, we OJTs are able to join the the
  gathering of NEC employees. They held it once every month, a small gathering
  with all the food and some entertaining stuffs. It was fun but really akward for me since
  all the employees were there but it seems really normal for them already.
  
  During this week also, our TL once again called for a meeting and 
  she have given us a task in BD. The task is to create operation sheets for 
  each main and subwindow of the application. Operation sheets provides all the
  information about all the things inside a main/sub-window where operation
  may occur.
